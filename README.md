When he wakes up in the morning, David has a number of options on how to travel. He could take the bus, cycle, carpool, or even drive himself to the office! But which one is the best option for him? And what is "best" anyway? Cheapest price? Shortest travel time? Most carbon efficient? Or most exercise? 

TakeMe2.space is the answer. It provides a personalised answer to the best way to get to work, based on the criteria that David sets. 

TakeMe2.space uses Here's Apis, to provide location services, travel time, local weather information etc. It also uses information from Statistics NZ, Ministry of Transport, and other New Zealand data sources.



TakeMe2.space is a Wellington GovHack 2017 project using open government data
